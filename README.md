## Description
In 2022, around 35 percent of adults in Canada are overweight or obese. Due to today's sedentary lifestyle, people often struggle to maintain a consistent fitness routine due to a lack of motivation and accountability. Despite understanding the importance of exercise and healthy habits, many individuals find it challenging to stay committed to regular physical activity. Additionally, the absence of immediate rewards or incentives often leads to a lack of motivation and eventual abandonment of fitness goals.

A lack of physical activity increases your risk for many diseases, such as osteoporosis, heart disease, obesity, and elevated levels of blood pressure and cholesterol. Unfortunately, this problem is escalating worldwide: a staggering proportion exceeding 80% of the adolescent demographic fails to meet the global recommended levels of physical activity. Furthermore, insufficiently active people have a 20%-30% higher risk of death.

To address this problem, we propose the development of a fitness app with a robust reward system. The app will leverage gamification techniques and behavioural psychology principles to motivate users to adopt and maintain a healthier lifestyle. It will suggest exercises and remind you to work out, customizable for beginners and active people.
